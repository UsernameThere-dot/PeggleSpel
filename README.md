# PeggleSpel

🎯 Peggle: Bounce Builders
Core Idea

You play on normal Peggle boards, but after every shot, you get to place one small object that changes the next shot.

🧱 Gameplay Loop

Shoot the ball.

Watch it bounce.

Place one item (like a bumper, mini-wall, spring peg, or triangle deflector).

Shoot again with your new setup.

🔧 Placeable Items

Bumper Peg: Adds a bouncy point.

Mini Wall: Alters the angle of the next bounce.

Spring Pad: Launches the ball upward.

Sticky Peg: Slows the ball for more precision.

You get 3–5 items per level total, so placement matters.

⭐ Hero Power (Simple)

Build-Burst Unicorn:
Next shot spawns extra temporary pegs on every item you placed for huge combo potential.

🎨 Theme

Bright, toy-like visuals. Boards look like little plastic playsets you’re adding pieces to.
